# Azure Kubernetes Service Cheat Sheet

**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** deploys *managed Kubernetes clusters*.  Azure will manage:

- Kubernetes masters
- Health monitoring
- Maintenance

The AKS service is free.  You only have to pay for the agent nodes, which you maintain.

AKS should be used when you require **full container orchestration**:

- service discovery across multiple containers
- automatic scaling
- co-ordinated application upgrades
- **Bridge to Kubernetes** is an **extension** in *Visual Studio* that allows developers to write, test and deploy microservice code on their development workstations.
