# Azure Policies Cheat Sheet

**Azure Policy** enforces organisation standards and assesses **compliance** at-scale.

Policies *do not restrict* access, they only observe for compliance.

Once a policy is assigned it will evaluate for the compliance state periodically.

The rules of a policy are described in a **policy definition** JSON file.

A **policy initiative** is group of policy definitions.
